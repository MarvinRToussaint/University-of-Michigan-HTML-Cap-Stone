# University-of-Michigan-HTML-Cap-Stone
umich online web development course first cap stone project
## January 1st, 2022
In order to provide a more structured approach to my self studies.
I decided to go through umich's web development course online. 
This course will provide me with a strong foundation that
will set my gradual learning up for years to come. I've 
gotten through the first part of the course, and have already learn
a strong foundation of HTML with semantics and accessability in mind. 
We also touched on git/github, as well as webhosting. 
I'm excited to continue through the course.

# The cap stone
The cap stone was to create this html page with the use of semantic tags.
The page is simple. It consists of a few sections, some progress bars and and image.
I must say even though I've known html to a while. I still learned about the details tag, 
which I felt was cool.
